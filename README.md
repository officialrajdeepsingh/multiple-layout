I built a demo of nextjs with multiple layout.

## Getting Started

Firstly clone the multiple-layout github repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/multiple-layout.git

# OR

cd multiple-layout

#  OR

pnpm install

```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
